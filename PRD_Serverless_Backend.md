# PRD: Serverless Backend for AI & Cloud Storage

**Date:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** Proposed
**Author:** Gemini Agent

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for moving the AI processing and receipt storage logic from the client-side to a serverless backend. This transition allows for **monetization** (via license keys), **security** (hiding API keys), and **resource management** (rate limiting & offloading heavy assets).

**Target Platform:** Cloudflare Pages Functions (integrates with current `wrangler` setup).
**Data Store:** Cloudflare KV (Key-Value) for license management.
**Blob Storage:** AWS S3 (or Cloudflare R2) for receipt images.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 User Authentication (License Keys)
*   **Strategy:** Bearer-token style API keys.
*   **Mechanism:** Every request from the client must include the header:
    `X-License-Key: <USER_LICENSE_KEY>`
*   **Validation:**
    1.  Serverless function checks if key exists in KV Store.
    2.  Checks if `status` is "active".
    3.  Checks if `expiration` (if applicable) is in the future.

### 2.2 Admin Authentication
*   **Strategy:** Shared Secret (Environment Variable).
*   **Mechanism:** Admin endpoints (key generation) require the header:
    `X-Admin-Secret: <SERVER_ADMIN_SECRET>`
*   **Security:** This secret is stored in Cloudflare Dashboard variables, never in code.

---

## 3. Data Model (KV Store)

The License Key acts as the primary key in the KV store.

**Key Format:** `license:<uuid>`

**Value Schema (JSON):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-v4-string",
  "created_at": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  "status": "active", // "active", "revoked", "expired"
  "tier": "pro", // "basic", "pro", "enterprise"
  "features": {
    "ai_enabled": true,
    "cloud_backup_enabled": true
  },
  "limits": {
    "ai_requests_per_month": 100,
    "storage_limit_mb": 1024
  },
  "usage": {
    "billing_cycle": "2025-12", // Year-Month
    "ai_requests_used": 14,
    "storage_used_mb": 12.5
  }
}
```

## 4. API Endpoints

### 4.1 Feature: AI Expense Extraction
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/ai/extract`

*   **Description:** Proxies requests to Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to extract expense details from text.
*   **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "text": "Lunch at Nandos 25.50",
      "categories": ["Food", "Transport"],
      "currency": "MYR"
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Validate `X-License-Key`.
    2.  Check if `usage.ai_requests_used < limits.ai_requests_per_month`.
    3.  If cycle changed (new month), reset `usage.ai_requests_used`.
    4.  Call Google Gemini API (using server-side secret).
    5.  Increment `usage.ai_requests_used` in KV.
    6.  Return extracted JSON.
*   **Response:**
    *   `200 OK`: `{ "data": <ExtractedExpense>, "remaining_quota": 85 }`
    *   `403 Forbidden`: Invalid Key.
    *   `429 Too Many Requests`: Monthly quota exceeded.

### 4.2 Feature: Receipt Upload (Presigned URL)
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/storage/upload-url`

*   **Description:** Generates a secure, temporary URL for the client to upload an image directly to S3/R2.
*   **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "filename": "receipt_123.jpg",
      "contentType": "image/jpeg",
      "sizeBytes": 500000
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Validate `X-License-Key`.
    2.  Validate file type (allow only images/pdf) and size (< 5MB).
    3.  Generate S3 Presigned PUT URL for key: `receipts/<license_id>/<timestamp>_<filename>`.
    4.  Return URL to client.
*   **Response:**
    *   `200 OK`: `{ "uploadUrl": "https://...", "fileKey": "receipts/..." }`

### 4.3 Feature: Receipt View (Presigned URL)
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/storage/view-url?key=<fileKey>`

*   **Description:** Generates a temporary URL to view a private image.
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Validate `X-License-Key`.
    2.  Verify `fileKey` starts with `receipts/<license_id>/` (Prevent viewing other users' files).
    3.  Generate S3 Presigned GET URL (valid for 1 hour).
    4.  Return URL.

### 4.4 Feature: License Status
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/license/status`

*   **Description:** Used by the UI to show "Pro" badge and usage bars.
*   **Response:**
    *   `200 OK`: Returns `tier`, `limits`, and `usage` objects from KV.

## 5. Admin Management API

These endpoints are for internal use (or connected to a payment webhook like Stripe) to provision access.

### 5.1 Create License
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/licenses`

*   **Headers:** `X-Admin-Secret: <SECRET>`
*   **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "tier": "pro",
      "duration_months": 12 // Optional, for expiration calc
    }
    ```
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Validate Admin Secret.
    2.  Generate a new UUID `key`.
    3.  Create the default KV object (see Section 3).
    4.  Store in KV.
*   **Response:**
    *   `201 Created`: `{ "licenseKey": "uuid-..." }`

### 5.2 Revoke License
**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/admin/licenses/:key`

*   **Headers:** `X-Admin-Secret: <SECRET>`
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Set `status` to "revoked" in KV. (Don't delete immediately to preserve usage history/audit).

---

## 6. Rate Limiting Strategy

1.  **Quota Reset:**
    *   The worker checks the `usage.billing_cycle` string (e.g., "2025-12").
    *   If `current_date_string != usage.billing_cycle`, reset counters to 0 and update `billing_cycle`.
2.  **Concurrency:**
    *   Cloudflare Workers scale automatically. We do not need to limit concurrency per se, but we limit *usage volume* via the counters above.
3.  **Abuse Prevention:**
    *   Failed auth attempts should be generic "403" to avoid key enumeration.
    *   Max request size limits (e.g., 100kb for JSON bodies).
    *   Usage limits are “best effort” and may slightly exceed quota.

## 7. Configuration Requirements (Environment Variables)

The following secrets must be set in the Cloudflare Pages project settings:

*   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google AI Studio Key.
*   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: For S3/R2.
*   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: For S3/R2.
*   `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`: Target bucket.
*   `AWS_REGION`: Bucket region.
*   `ADMIN_SECRET`: High-entropy string for admin operations.
*   `KV_NAMESPACE_ID`: ID of the bound KV namespace.

## 8. Security & Prompt Defense

### 8.1 Prompt Injection Mitigation
To prevent users from hijacking the LLM for general-purpose chat or creative writing (Token Theft):

1.  **Strict Output Parsing:** The backend must attempt to parse the AI response as JSON. If `JSON.parse()` fails, the response is discarded, and an error is returned. The user never sees the raw text.
2.  **Input Length Cap:** The `/api/ai/extract` endpoint will reject any input string longer than **300 characters**. Legitimate expense descriptions are rarely longer than this.
3.  **Token Limit:** The Gemini API call will be configured with `maxOutputTokens: 500`. This prevents the generation of long-form content.
4.  **Deterministic Sampling:** Set `temperature: 0` to minimize creativity and hallucination.
5.  **Schema Enforcement:** Use Gemini's `responseMimeType: "application/json"` feature (where supported) or appended system instructions ("Output ONLY JSON") to strictly constrain the format.

### 8.2 Abuse Prevention
1.  **Rate Limiting:** As defined in Section 6, the hard cap on monthly requests limits the financial exposure per compromised or malicious user.
2.  **Presigned URL Constraints:**
    *   Upload URLs are valid for only **60 seconds**.
    *   `Content-Length-Range` header will be enforced in the S3 signature to prevent uploading files larger than 5MB.
    *   `Content-Type` must match image/pdf types.
3.  **Isolation:** Users can only access objects under `receipts/<their_license_id>/`. Path traversal attacks are mitigated by strict key generation on the server.

## 9. AI Behavior & System Prompt

### 9.1 Interaction Model
The AI acts as a **Conversational Data Extraction Agent**. It does not assume single-shot success.

*   **Stateless Backend:** The server does NOT store conversation history.
*   **Stateful Client:** The client must send the `current_state` (partially collected data) and `history` (previous messages) with each new user input.

### 9.2 Updated API Request Schema (Section 4.1)
The `/api/ai/extract` endpoint is updated to support conversational context.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "userInput": "It was 50 bucks",
  "currentDate": "2025-12-31T10:00:00Z",
  "categories": ["Food", "Transport", "Shopping"],
  "currency": "MYR",
  "previousState": { // Optional: Data collected so far
    "name": "makan tengah hari",
    "amount": 50,
    "category": null,
    "date": "2025-12-31T10:00:00Z",
    "notes": "",
    "confidence": "low",
    "missingFields": ["category"]
  },
  "history": [ // Optional: Last 3 turns for context
    { "role": "user", "text": "I had dinner" },
    { "role": "assistant", "text": "Okay, how much was it?" }
  ]
}
```

### 9.3 System Prompt Definition

**Persona:**
> You are a precise and helpful Personal Finance Assistant. Your ONLY goal is to extract a valid expense record from the conversation. You speak concisely.

**Logic Flow:**
1.  Analyze `userInput` in the context of `history` and `previousState`.
2.  **IF** you can infer ALL required fields (Name, Amount, Category, Date):
    *   Set `status` to "complete".
    *   Populate `data` with the final record.
    *   `assistant_message` is null.
3.  **IF** information is missing or ambiguous (e.g., "bought food" -> missing amount):
    *   Set `status` to "incomplete".
    *   Populate `data` with what you HAVE found so far.
    *   Set `assistant_message` to a natural language question asking for the *specific* missing piece.
    *   **Defense:** Do not answer general knowledge questions. Reply: "I can only help you track expenses. Please provide the details."

**Output JSON Schema:**
```json
{
  "status": "complete" | "incomplete",
  "data": {
    "name": "string (nullable)",
    "amount": "number (nullable)",
    "category": "string (nullable)",
    "date": "ISO-string (nullable)",
    "notes": "string",
    "confidence": "high" | "low",
    "missingFields": ["string"]
  },
  "assistant_message": "string (nullable)"
}
```

### 9.4 Edge Cases
*   **Currency:** If user says "bucks" or "dollars" but context is `MYR`, assume `MYR` unless explicitly stated otherwise (e.g., "USD 50").
*   **Date:** "Today" = `currentDate`. "Yesterday" = `currentDate - 1 day`.
*   **Ambiguity:** If user says "Apple", ask: "Was this 'Groceries' or 'Electronics'?" instead of guessing.

## 10. Client Implementation Requirements

### 10.1 Double Submission Prevention
To protect against accidental double-charging of the AI quota and UI glitches:
1.  **Loading State:** The "Send" button in the AI Chat must be disabled immediately upon click.
2.  **Input Lock:** The text input field should be read-only while a request is in flight.
3.  **Visual Feedback:** A "Thinking..." or loading spinner must be shown in the chat window to indicate background processing.

### 10.2 State Persistence
1.  **In-Memory State:** The `current_state` (partial expense data) should be kept in the component state or a dedicated store during the conversation.
2.  **Reset:** The state must be cleared once an expense is successfully created or the user manually cancels the flow.
3.  **Prompt Construction:** The client is responsible for sending the `previousState` to the backend. The backend will inject this state into the System Prompt so the AI understands the progress (e.g., "We already know the amount is RM 50. Now we just need the category.").
